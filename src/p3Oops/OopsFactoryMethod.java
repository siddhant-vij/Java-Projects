// The factory method is a creational design pattern, i.e., related to object creation.
// In the Factory pattern, we create objects without exposing the creation logic to the client and the client uses the same common interface to create a new type of object.
// The idea is to use a static member-function (static factory method) that creates & returns instances, hiding the details of class modules from the user.
// A factory pattern is one of the core design principles to create an object, allowing clients to create objects of a library(explained below) in a way such that it doesnâ€™t have a tight coupling with the class hierarchy of the library.
// What is meant when we talk about libraries and clients? 
// A library is something that is provided by some third party that exposes some public APIs and clients make calls to those public APIs to complete their tasks. A very simple example can be different kinds of Views provided by Android OS.
// Example Statement: Consider we want to implement a notification service through email, SMS, and push notifications. We could have an interface called Notification, and three concrete classes are implementing the Notification interface. A factory class NotificationFactory is created to get a Notification object (similar to getMovie() implemented in Movie Class)
